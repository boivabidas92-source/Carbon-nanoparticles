# Carbon Nanoparticle Research Initiative

**Author:** Boivabi  
**Status:** Early-stage student research

## Overview
This repository documents an exploratory student project investigating fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CQDs), their stability, and related conceptual subprojects (Vetrios — carbon ion architecture, nanotube design, and nanocarriers).

## Structure
- `/fluorescence-core/` — experimental photos, notes, raw images, and CSV data (brightness measurements).
- `/vetrios/` — conceptual notes and diagrams for carbon ion architecture (MCIS concept).
- `/nanotube-notes/` — sketches and basic modeling notes on CNT fragments and pores.
- `/nanocarrier/` — theoretical notes on drug-delivery proxies and safe-lab limitations.

## Fluorescence core summary
- Sample made: 31 Oct (home CQD synthesis)  
- Re-checked: 25 Nov — observed **brighter and lighter** fluorescence.  
- Storage: sealed bottle, refrigerated.  
- Tests included: stability photos, top-vs-mixed aliquot photos, dilution tests.
- Data files: `fluorescence-data.csv` (in `/fluorescence-core/`)

## How to reproduce my basic observations (high level)
1. Prepare CQD solution (safe household recipe).  
2. Store refrigerated and photograph under UV at fixed settings.  
3. Record images with reference card and extract brightness via ImageJ or RGB analysis.  
4. Compare top-layer vs mixed aliquots to test settling/quenchers.

## Notes & limitations
- Small-scale, home-based work. No clinical or industrial claims.  
- All biomedical concepts are theoretical only; no in vivo testing performed.  
- Computational files are small demos or conceptual notes only.
